This assignment asked us to convert a java application to C# application.
I did this using Microsoft Visual Studio. Using visual studio made this porting 
process a bit simpler. I quickly realise the important parts of my gui application.
LightSwitch.cs -- This is the class which calls the Items.cs class's 
		  InitializeComponent method which assembles everything together.
Items.cs -- This class puts all the components together. This class has the 
	    eventhandler function which makes the label change when the button 
	    is clicked.
Program.cs -- This is the class which contains the Main method. This is the main entry
	      main entry point into the application.

The LightSwitch.java class builds up the frame and adds the buttons to the Panel. The
LightSwitch.cs class just calls the InitializeComponent method from its constructor 
which puts everything together. The LightSwitch.java class is the driver program. The 
driver program for the C# implementation is also the LightSwitch.cs class.
The Items.cs class has all the different components. The Initialize component method 
initializes button, label and the form. It also adds an EventHandler, button1_Click()
to the button. button1_CLick() increases the count every time and changes the button 
text and the label text when the button is clicked. If the count is even, the button 
says off, if odd it says on.

C# is somewhat similar to Java. It implements oop. C# is a difficult language. Without 
the help from Visual Studio it would have been even more difficult to port the Java code 
to C#.

To run the program, type "Doit" on the command line. If the program does not run, do:
$ chmod +x Doit
$ Doit
